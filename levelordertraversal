Problem Statement

Print the level order traversal of this tree. In level order traversal, 
we visit the nodes level by level from left to right. You only have to 
complete the function.

Example:
    1
      \
       2
        \
         5
        /  \
       3    6
        \
         4  
         
Output:
1 -> 2 -> 5 -> 3 -> 6 -> 4
